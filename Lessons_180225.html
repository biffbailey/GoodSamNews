		Epistle: 1 Peter 3: 18 - 22
		</div>
		<div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; font-style:italic;">
		<sup>18</sup>For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous
		 for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death 
		 in the flesh, but made <em style="font-size:1.3em; color:#c2b280">alive in the spirit, <sup>19</sup>in which also 
		 he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, 
		 <sup>20</sup>who in former times did not obey, when God waited 
		 patiently in the days of Noah</em>, during the building of the ark, 
		 in which a few, that is, eight people, were saved through water.
		 <sup>21</sup>And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you &mdash; as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.
