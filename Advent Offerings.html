<div style="margin:1.5em;text-align: center; font-style:italic; font-size:1.15em;padding-left:1em;">
	God is with us in amazing and powerful ways, bringing shining new hope into the world.
	 Like Mary and Elizabeth so long ago, the ministry of our church is radiant with 
	 that great hope. And like Mary and Elizabeth, our congregation and the whole Church
	  also trusts in the promises of God. In our giving this morning, our joy overflows
	   in generosity.</div>
	   
Let us gather our gifts together and present them as an offering to God.</div>
