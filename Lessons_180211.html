			<sup>8</sup>Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, 
			and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side
			 and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.
			</div>
			<div style="margin-top:1em;">
			<sup>9</sup>When they had crossed, 
			Elijah said to Elisha, <q>Tell me what I may do for you, 
			before I am taken from you.</q> 
			<em style="color:blue;font-size:1.3em;">
				Elisha said, <q>Please let me inherit 
				a double share of your spirit.</q> 
			</em>	
			<sup>10</sup>He responded, <q>You have 
			asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from
			 you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.</q> 
			 <sup>11</sup>As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of
			  fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah 
			  ascended in a whirlwind into heaven. <sup>12</sup>Elisha kept 
			  watching and crying out, <q>Father, father! The chariots of Israel 
			  and its horsemen!</q> But when he could no longer see him, 
			  he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.

			<sup>2</sup> Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, 
			and led them up a high mountain apart, by themselves. And he was 
			transfigured before them, <sup>3</sup>and his clothes became 
			<em style="color:red; font-size:1.3em;">

			5Then Peter said to Jesus, <q>Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; 
			let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one 
			for Elijah.</q> <sup>6</sup>He did not know what to say, for 
			<em style="color:red; font-size:1.3em;">
			they were terrified. 
			</em>
			<sup>7</sup>Then a cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud 
			there came a voice, <q>This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!</q>  
			<sup>8</sup>Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one 
			with them any more, but only Jesus.
